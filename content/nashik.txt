Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha is a Hindu religious mela held every 12 years in the Nashik district of Maharashtra, India. The name of the festival is also transliterated as Sinhastha or Singhastha. It is one of the four fairs traditionally recognized as Kumbha Melas, and is also known as Nashik-Trimbak Kumbha Mela or Nashik Kumbha Mela.

The fair involves ritual bathing on the banks of Godavari river, at the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple (in Trimbak) and the Ram Kund in Nashik. Until 1789, the fair was held only at Trimbak, but after a clash between Vaishnavites and Saivites, the Maratha Peshwa segregated the Vaishnavites to the Nashik city.

<b>Dates</b>
<br><br>
The Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha is held once in 12 years. The exact datees are determined according to a combination of zodiac positions: the mela ay be held when Jupiter is in Leo (Simha in Hindu astrology); or when Jupiter, Sun and Moon are in Cancer on lunar conjunction (Amavasya).

The last fair was held in 2015; the next one will be held in 2027.
